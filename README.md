# Proyecto_ETL_OLAP
This is a business intelligence project that allows data analysis from data warehouses, OLAP cubes and also the “Power Bi” visualization tool. An ETL process was built using the SSIS tool. With this, it is planned to have better decision-making and have the entire business under analysis, regardless of the department.
